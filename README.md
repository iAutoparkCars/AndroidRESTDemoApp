Networking with Retrofit2
MVVM design pattern
data binding
ConstraintLayouts for the UI
RecyclerView for the list views
jsonschema2pojo

* The "MainActivity" is the CreateUserActivity
* All the UI logic of the CreateUserActivity is in CreateUserViewModel;
  the MVVM design allows the separation of view and viewmodel for
  decoupling, testing, modify-ability, and thus scalability.
* The code is roughly well-documented for ease of understanding.
  One should not struggle to read teammate's code.
